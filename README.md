HabitAi is an application designed to help people boost their productivity using AI (artificial intelligence).

Currently under active development. The tech stack includes Flutter, React, Vue, Symfony, PHP 8.3, and the architecture follows Clean Architecture principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Atomic Design.

New frontend improvements:

Implemented Cache-Then-Network (CTN) system for optimized data fetching and faster response times.

Integrated IndexedDB (IDB) for persistent client-side caching, allowing offline access and reducing server load.

The data layer architecture has been updated to support centralized caching and efficient state management.

Features such as task management, Eisenhower matrix, Pomodoro timer, and multilingual support for 5 languages are already implemented but still being refined.

Stay tuned for updates!
