TaskFlow

TaskFlow is an application designed to help people boost their productivity using AI (artificial intelligence).

Currently under active development. The tech stack includes Flutter, React, Vue, Symfony, PHP 8.3, and the architecture follows Clean Architecture principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Atomic Design.

Features such as task management, Eisenhower matrix, Pomodoro timer, and multilingual support for 5 languages are already implemented but still being refined.

Stay tuned for updates!
